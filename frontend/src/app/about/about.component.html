    <h2>1 General</h2>
    <p>
      In group work, ideally all members contribute equally to the overall
      success of the project, but usually in individually different ways. Peer
      grading is used to evaluate individual contributions in group work
      ([Kaufman et.al. 1999], [Brutus & Donia 2010]), in our context the online
      tool PGT is used for this purpose. Each group member grades all other
      group members (peer grading) as well as himself/herself (self-grading)
      according to definable criteria and receives an evaluation in the form of
      an anonymized comparison. The evaluations are done with a point scale
      according to definable weighted criteria.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lecturer (resp. teacher or instructor) can configure a peer grading with
      regard to the number and designation of the criteria, their weighting and
      the point scale, as well as the start and end date for the period of the .
      After the peer grading , the lecturer receives a mail notification with
      all individual and group evaluations. This allows the lecturer to compare
      his assessment of the group contribution of individual group members with
      the peer evaluations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the instructor and the participants can use their respective
      evaluations to reflect on the teaching and learning process and benefit
      from them for further group work.

    <h2>2 Other Peer Grading Tools</h2>
    <p>
      Comparable peer grading tools are either only commercially available with
      a licensing model (e.g.,
      <a href="https://info.catme.org/features/peer-evaluation/" target="_blank"
        >CATME from Purdue University</a
      >), or have limitations such as requiring participants to have a Google
      account (<a
        href="https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/peergrading_tool/815094938046"
        target="_blank"
        >peer grading tool as a plugin for Google Spreadsheets</a
      >), which does not go along with the idea of an open software system.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Moodle activity "Workshop" is similar to the desired peer grading
      scenario. However, analysis has shown that essential aspects that are
      realized in the PGT tool regarding functionality, level of detail,
      flexibility and customization are not available. Thus, the PGT tool was
      implemented in December 2022 as an in-house development at the
      <a href="https://www.bfh.ch/wirtschaft/" target="_blank"
        >Dep. of Business of the Bern Univ. of Applied Sciences (BUAS)</a
      >
      with Angular technology resulting in a web based application, funded by
      the
      <a href="https://virtuelleakademie.ch/foerderung/" target="_blank"
        >BFH E-Learning Förderprogramm</a
      >.

    <h2>3 Functionality</h2>
    <p>
      <b>a)</b>
      Creation of a peer grading process by the lecturer incl. import of
      participants in shape of a (UTF-8) csv file with participant name,
      (optional) matriculation number, email address, and group number.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./assets/PG_Edit_Campaign.png" alt="Create Campaign View" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      <b>b)</b> Each group member receives an email with a link to the
      individualized peer grading sheet and fills it out completely (input
      values are validated).
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./assets/PG_Grading.png" alt="Peer Grading Form" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      <b>c)</b> Upon completion of the peer grading, all participants and the
      instructor receive evaluations via email.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./assets/PG_Review_Group.png" alt="Campaign Review" />
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <img src="./assets/PG_Review_Peer.png" alt="Peer Grading Review" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      In this example, the peer grading is based on 4 criteria with points 1..8.
      The documentation with the meaning of the criteria and the point scales is
      outside the PGT system and is to be made known to the participants by
      other means (see example for criteria catalog below). The evaluations of
      one's own contributions by other group members are anonymized to the
      extent that only the mean value of all third-party evaluations is given
      and thus exact conclusions about evaluating persons are not possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group average is calculated by averaging all third-party assessments
      within a group. For each group member, the deviation between the group
      average and the average of the third-party assessments of the individual
      group member can be determined from this. In the evaluation section, the
      difference between self-assessment and third-party assessment is also
      shown, which enables critical reflection also with regard to future
      teamwork. The group average is calculated by averaging all third-party
      assessments within a group.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>d)</b> The lecturer has control over the peer grading process at any
      time:
    </p>

        src="./assets/PG_Campaign_Overview.png"
        alt="Campaign overview after invitations sent"
      />
    </figure>

    <h2>4 Criteria catalog</h2>
    <p>
      It is by decision not presented by the PGT system, since it is usually
      available as a semi-structured document and would have to be imported or
      entered in a time-consuming complex manner. Here is an example from the
      course
      <a href="https://showroom-bsc.digisus-lab.ch/" target="_blank">
        Business Case Studies" (BCS)
      </a>
      in the Department of Business at the Bern University of Applied Sciences.
      It is presented in the study guide of the course. The standard score for a
      "good" assessment is set at 5/6 points.
